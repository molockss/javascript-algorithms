Explaining the buildUrl interview coding challenge

This code defines a function called buildUrl that takes in a single argument called data.

The first line inside the function uses destructuring assignment to unpack two properties from the data object, name and timestamps, and assign them to variables of the same name.

The next line creates a new array called validTimestamps using the Array.prototype.filter() method. This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function tests if the element is a positive integer using the Number.isInteger() method and whether it is greater than 0.

The following line sorts the validTimestamps array in ascending order using the Array.prototype.sort() method. The method takes a compare function as an argument, which is used to determine the order of the elements. The function compares the two elements, a and b, and returns a negative value if a is less than b, a positive value if a is greater than b, and 0 if they are equal.

The next line declares a variable called duration and assigns it the value returned by the getDurationLabel() function, which is called with validTimestamps[0] and validTimestamps[validTimestamps.length - 1] as arguments. This function calculates and returns a duration label for the time period between two timestamps.

The following block of code calculates the median timestamp of the validTimestamps array. It first calculates the median index using the Math.floor() function and a conditional operator. If the length of the validTimestamps array is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, it calculates the median as the middle element.

The next line declares a variable called medianDuration and assigns it the value returned by the getDurationLabel() function, which is called with validTimestamps[0] and medianTimestamp as arguments. This function calculates and returns a duration label for the time period between two timestamps.

The following line uses template literals to build a URL string and assign it to the url variable. Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions. They are denoted with backticks () and expressions are denoted with the ${}syntax. In this case, the URL string includes thename, duration, and medianDuration` variables interpolated using template literals.

The final line of the buildUrl function returns the url variable.

The code also includes a helper function called getDurationLabel, which takes two arguments, startTimestamp and endTimestamp, and calculates and returns a duration label for the time period between the two timestamps. It does this by calculating the number of seconds, minutes, and hours between the two timestamps and returning a string in the format "XhYminZs".

Finally, the code exports the buildUrl function as the default export.
